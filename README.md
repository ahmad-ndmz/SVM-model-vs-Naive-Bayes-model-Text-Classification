# SVM-model-vs-Naive-Bayes-model-Text-Classification

Two models will be evaluated, the Multinomial Naïve Bayes and Linear Support Vector Machine. Two datasets will be used, the hatespeech dataset and the sexism dataset. 

Steps 

1. Data exploration - Data exploration is used to examine and display data to gain initial insights or find regions or trends worth further study. 
2. Data Cleaning - To ensure that the datasets are cleaned and properly arranged.This will include managing missing values and data transformation.  
3. Text Pre-processing - Involves removing unwanted text, stop words, punctuations, etc.
4. Data Visualization - Data visualisation tools make trends, outliers, and patterns in data more easily visible and understandable via the use of visual components like charts, graphs, and maps.
5. Modelling - There will be two modelling techniques that will be evaluated which are the Multinomial Naïve Bayes and Linear Support Vector Machine. Model tuning was also done to increase the accuracy of the model.
6. Data Evaluation Criteria - An accuracy score and a classification report will be used to evaluate the final output.
